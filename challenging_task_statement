# Project Statement -- Meeting Scheduler with Reminders

##  Problem Statement

Managing daily meetings can become difficult without a proper tracking
system. Users may miss important events due to poor organization or
forgetting scheduled meetings. There is a need for a simple,
lightweight, offline solution that allows users to add, view, delete,
and get reminders for meetings using a command‑line interface.

##  Scope of the Project

-   This project focuses on providing essential meeting management
    features.
-   It uses a text file (`bucket.txt`) for persistent storage.
-   It is designed as a CLI tool for quick use without requiring
    internet or external dependencies.
-   The scope does not include advanced integrations such as calendar
    syncing or automated notifications (future enhancements possible).

##  Target Users

-   Students needing a lightweight meeting/task tracker\
-   Professionals who want a minimal offline meeting reminder tool\
-   Beginners learning Python file handling and datetime manipulation\
-   Anyone who wants a small, no‑setup scheduling system

##  High-Level Features

-   Add new meetings with date and time validation\
-   Display all stored meetings in sorted order\
-   Delete selected meetings\
-   Reminder system for meetings happening within the next 24 hours\
-   Automatic loading and saving of meetings using a text file
